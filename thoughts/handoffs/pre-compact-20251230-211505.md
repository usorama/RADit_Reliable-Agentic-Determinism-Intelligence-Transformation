# Pre-Compact Handoff
**Created**: 2025-12-30T21:15:05.665158
**Source**: unknown compaction
**Project**: RADit_Reliable-Agentic-Determinism-Intelligence-Transformation

## ⚠️ CONTEXT WAS COMPACTED

This handoff was auto-created before compaction.
Read this file to recover context after compaction.

## Recovery Instructions

1. Read PROGRESS.md or MASTER_TASKS.md for current state
2. Read project CLAUDE.md for task tracking
3. Check TodoWrite for any pending tasks
4. Resume work from where compaction interrupted

## Progress Files to Check
- PROGRESS.md
- MASTER_TASKS.md
- docs/planning/tasks.json
- thoughts/ledgers/*.md

## Key Reminder
**Update progress files CONSTANTLY, not just before compaction!**
These files are your memory - conversation context is not.
